This is a  html/js basic remake of 1995 game Cheesy Pursuit. [https://www.mobygames.com/game/cheesy-pursuit](https://www.mobygames.com/game/cheesy-pursuit)



I lost my Grandma to COVID-19 on April 8th 2020. In remembering her, I remembered she loved to play Cheesy Pursuit. We all did. I remember when we first got the disc [24 games for windows 95](https://archive.org/details/24GamesForWindows95 "24 games for windows 95"). I was with my Grandma and we were at a computer store in New Jersey called [CompUSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CompUSA "CompUSA").The game was on sale and my Grandma got it for us. Over the years with new computers, my Grandma would always install this game to play. She eventually stoped playing because the disc was too scratched and wouldn’t install. She also started using her iPad a lot more and this game is not on it. 

Losing someone is hard. I built this project because it was one of my Grandmas favorite games and it did not exist so I created it.  It was my way of coping.  I wish I would have thought of this before my Grandma passed because she would have been so happy to play it again but I learned a lot working on this project so in her own way my Grandma is still helping me and pushing me to be better. 



I don’t own any rights to this game.
